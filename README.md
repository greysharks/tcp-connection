## Chapter 1: Overall structure of the program

My program is intended to show basical example of client-server message exchange using TCP protocol. For this purpose both a client and a server have their implementation (using connection-oriented Berkeley sockets) in a single program. 

Logically, the program can be devided in two parts:  
1. Creating a TCP socket and configuring structure for addresses of the Internet address family  
2. Initializing a server or a client based on a flag value provided by command-line arguments and using previously created and configured socket and structure for addresses (visualization in the image below).

Below are also two examples of this program running with different command-line arguments:  
- *first image* is the initialization of a local server on a hard coded port 80  
- *second image* is the initialization of a client that receives message from that server (and then closes connection).

So, in the next chapter I will describe mine solution for the creation of socket and the configuration of structure for addresses.

## Chapter 2: Ð¡reation of socket and configuration of sockaddr_in structure

This is the first logical part of my program and this is where IP address, port number and address family are assigned to the object of sockaddr_in structure, and then the socket is created based on the same address family, some type of connection (commonly byte-stream socket or datagram socket) and some protocol (commonly TCP or UDP).

Common values used with socket function are as follows:
1. Domain `AF_INET` is used to connect via address for IP version 4 (or IP-v4) and `AF_INET6` sets a connection via connect via address for IP version 6 (or IP-v6).
2. Type `SOCK_STREAM` is used to transmit data by TCP protocol and `SOCK_DGRAM` sets data transmission by UDP protocol.  
3. Protocol 0 is used to let the system choose a default protocol appropriate for the requested socket type, it can also be specified manually by using `IPPROTO_TCP` macros for TCP protocol and `IPPROTO_UDP` macros for UDP protocol.

For sockaddr_in structure there are less possible values:
1. `sin_family` can hold only `AF_INET` (because this structure was created to work only with IP-v4 addresses).  
2. `sin_port` holds short unsigned integer for port number (max value is 65535), transformed in network byte order (using `uint16_t htons(uint16_t hostshort);`).  
3. `sin_addr` holds an IP-v4 address in numeric binary form.

IP-v4 address for `sin_addr` can be either added using `int inet_pton(int af, const char *restrict src, void *restrict dst);` function to create it from text string (e.g. from `"127.0.0.1"`) or manually created and transformed in network byte order (using `uint32_t htonl(uint32_t hostlong);`) and then added to `s_addr` member. Another option is that `s_addr` member of `sin_addr` can be just assigned with `INADDR_ANY` macros (which means that the socket can connect or be connected to any address).

In the next chapter I will describe how I manually created numeric binary form for local address `127.0.0.1` which I used in my program.

## Chapter 3: IP address

In this project I decided to use custom IP-v4 address, which is local address `127.0.0.1`. For this purpose I manually converted four decimal numbers of one byte size each into one unsigned 32-bit integer and then used `uint32_t htonl(uint32_t hostlong);` function to change the number's byte order from host to network.

So, in order to explain how I've done this, I should mention first that one byte consists of 8 bits. Example of one byte, which is number one, is shown below.

![image](./images/1_byte.jpg)

So looking at possible values of 8-bit numbers we can see that the maximum value of one byte is 255. And this is perfectly suitable for IP-v4 addresses, because each segment of this address consists (exactly!) of numbers between 0 and 255 (inclusively). 

![image](./images/max_1_byte_value.jpg)

So in total, IP-v4 addresses have size of four bytes or 32 bits (four 8-bit numbers).

![image](./images/ip-v4_address_structure.jpg)

And this is exactly the size of an unsigned 32-bit integer number or just `unsigned int` in C (there is also an equivalent type `uint32_t`, which is used in headers like `<netinet/in.h>`, but in practice both are just same type and they easily convert to each other). So, we could just create `unsigned int` variable to hold **the entire IP-v4 address** !

![image](./images/uint32_t_size.jpg)

Let's see an example. Below is some random IP-v4 address represented as four decimal numbers.

![image](./images/example_of_ip-v4_address_in_form_of_4_decimal_numbers.jpg)

Below is the same example of IP-v4 address but this time represented as one 32-bit number (in binary).

![image](./images/example_of_ip-v4_address_in_form_of_1_binary_number.jpg)

So you in the image below you can clearly see that each 8-bit segment from unsigned 32-bit integer represents one decimal number.

![image](./images/example_of_ip-v4_address_binary_vs_decimal.jpg)

So we can see that each next segment of IP-v4 address starts right after the previous one. That means that the initial bit of each segment is positioned 8 bits further than the one of the previous segment. If we now compare how each segment is positioned in regard of the first one, then we see that the first segment is positioned 0 bits further than itself, the second segment is positioned 8 bits further than the first one, the third segment is positioned 16 (= 8 \* 2) bits further that the frist one and finally the fourth segment is positioned 24 (= 8 \* 3) bits further than the first one. Another fact that we should recall is that the first 8-bit number of IP-v4 address is the fourth segment of 32-bit address representation, the second number is the third segment and so on. Knowing all of that we can define the 32-bit representation of IP address as the sum of four 8-bit numbers bitwise shifted to the left accordingly to their position in address.

![image](./images/4_numbers_of_1_byte_into_1_uint32_t.jpg)

We can also extract each 8-bit number of address from the 32-bit representation by using bitwise AND on the segment that we want to extract (similar to the principle of subnet masks) and then bitwise shifting the number to the right.
